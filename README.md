# Supplemental_Material
This is the official GitHub Repo for the Supplementary Material of the Masters Thesis. 
Plots and stats of unshown results are documented by the following structure. Mostly the remaining plots of the association testing methods for the unshown outcomes
Campesterol,Sitostabol, Sitosterol and Stigmasterol. Also training stats, the Bayesian Net (plus Bootstrapping net) and decoded features for all virtual patients cohorts. virtual SNP genotypes are shown for two representative subgraphs. Remaining ones can be compiled and uploaded if interested.

* #### GEMMA: 
    Results of standard approach for each outcome shown within a Manhattan plot.
  
* #### Gene-bases_Testing
    Summarizes p-values of GenePy, Burden and SKAT-O based testing for all genes shown within a bar plots for each outcome.

* #### Polygenic_Risk_Score_Analysis
